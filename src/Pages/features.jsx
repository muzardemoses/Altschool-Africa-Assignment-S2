				<div className="features-article">
					<h3>
						<span >1</span> Intelligence
					</h3>
					<p>
						Artificial intelligence ac can be a controversial technology,
						including how its terminology is applied as well as the subjective
						nature of AI and whether or not it could ever constitute a form of
						consciousness.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						Machines still lack a true “emotional intelligence,” and it’s
						probably better if they never have their own emotions– unless we
						want to see our Alexa refusing to work because she’s angry or sad.
						However, the ability of modern AI to recognize human emotion may be
						beneficial.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div className="features-article">
					<h3>
						<span>2</span> Sense Perception
					</h3>
					<p>
						The technology that empowers robot senses has fostered our ability
						to communicate electronically for many years. Electronic
						communication mechanisms, such as microphones and cameras, help
						transmit sensory data to computers within simulated nervous systems.
						Sense is useful, if not fundamental to robots’ interaction with
						live, natural environments.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						The ability to sense and perceive the world around us is a
						fundamental aspect of human intelligence. Robots are no exception.
						Robots need to be able to sense their environment in order to
						interact with it. This is a key component of the robot’s ability to
						learn and adapt to its environment.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div className="features-article">
					<h3>
						<span>3</span> Dexterity
					</h3>
					<p>
						Dexterity refers to the functionality of limbs, appendages and
						extremities, as well as the general range of motor skill and
						physical capability of a body. In robotics, dexterity is maximized
						where there is a balance between sophisticated hardware and
						high-level programming that incorporates environmental sensing
						capability
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						One of the most important features of a robot is its ability to
						manipulate objects. Robots need to be able to move their limbs and
						hands in order to pick up and manipulate objects. This is a key
						component of the robot’s ability to learn and adapt to its
						environment.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div className="features-article">
					<h3>
						<span>4</span> Power
					</h3>
					<p>
						Robots require an energy source, and there are many factors that go
						into deciding which form of power provides the most freedom and
						capability for a robotic body. There are many different ways to
						generate, transmit and store power. Generators, batteries and fuel
						cells give power that is locally stored but also temporary, while
						tethering to a power source naturally limits the device’s freedom
						and range of functions.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						One very notable exception would be the simple machine-based bipedal
						walking system that relies only on gravity to propel its walk cycle
						(developed at Japan’s Nagoya Institute of Technology). While this
						may not qualify as a stand-alone (no pun intended) robot, it could
						lead to innovations on how robot power could potentially be
						optimized, or possibly even generated.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div className="features-article">
					<h3>
						<span>5</span> Independence
					</h3>
					<p>
						Independence is the ability of a robot to operate without human
						intervention. This is a key component of the robot’s ability to
						learn and adapt to its environment.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						Intelligence, sense, dexterity and power all converge to enable
						independence, which in turn could theoretically lead to a nearly
						personified individualization of robotic bodies. From its origin
						within a work of speculative fiction, the word “robot” has almost
						universally referred to artificially intelligent machinery with a
						certain degree of humanity to its design and concept (however
						distant).
